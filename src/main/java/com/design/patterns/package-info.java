/**
 * SOLID is a mnemonic for five design principles intended to
 * make software designs more understandable, flexible and
 * maintainable.

 * 
 * S ingle Responsibility Principle
 * O pen/Closed Principle
 * L iskov Substitution Principle
 * I nterface Segregation Principle
 * D ependency Inversion Principle
 * 
 * 
 * Single Responsibility Principle
 * - A class should have just one reason to change.
 * 
 * Open/Closed Principle
 * - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 * 
 * Liskov Substitution Principle
 * - When extending a class, remember that you should be able to pass objects of 
 * the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code.
 * 
 * Interface Segregation Principle
 * - Clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
 * 
 * Dependency Inversion Principle
 * - High-level classes shouldn’t depend on low-level classes. Both should depend 
 * on abstractions. Abstractions shouldn’t depend on details. Details should 
 * depend on abstractions.

 * TDD  (Design and Implementation of Unit Tests before implement the feature)
 * 
 * 
 * DDD  (Relationship and Strategy between DEV team and DOMAIN/BUSINESS team to define and talk about features to understand each other)
